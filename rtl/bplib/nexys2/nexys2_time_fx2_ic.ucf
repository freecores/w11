## timing rules for a 30 MHz internal clock design:
##   Period:   30 MHz
##   clk->out: longest setup time in FX2 is t_SRD (clk->SLRD) of 18.7 ns
##               clk->out < 33.3-18.7 = 14.6 ns
##               --> use 10 ns
##

## The nexys2 board has unfortunately the FX2 IFCLK *not* connected to a
## clock capable pin -> not ok when FX2 uses internal clock. So allow par
## to route from a 'normal' pin to a clock net. Not nice, compromizes the
## timing, but unavoidable on nexys2 (Note: nexys3 and atlys are ok).
## In practice IFCLK to pad times are quite similar on nexys2 and nexys3...
