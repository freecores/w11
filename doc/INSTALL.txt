1. Download ---------------------------------------------------------------

  All instructions below assume that the project files reside in a
  working directory with the name represented as <wdir>

  To download latest tagged version (V0.5) of w11a

    cd <wdir>
    svn co http://opencores.org/ocsvn/w11/w11/tags/w11a_V0.5

  To download latest snapshot of trunk

    cd <wdir>
    svn co http://opencores.org/ocsvn/w11/w11/trunk

2. Setup environment variables --------------------------------------------

  The make flow for building test benches (ghdl and ISim based) and systems
  (Xilinx xst based) as well as the support software (mainly the rlink backend
  server) requires

    - the definition of the environment variables:
      - RETROBASE: must refer to the installation root directory
      - BOOSTINC:  pathname for includes of boost library
    - that the tools binary directory is in the path
    - that the tools library directory is in the library path
    

  For bash and alike use

    export RETROBASE=<wdir>
    export PATH=$PATH:$RETROBASE/tools/bin
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$RETROBASE/tools/lib

  In most cases the boost library version coming with the distribution will
  work, in those cases simply use

    export BOOSTINC=/usr/include

  After that building functional model based test benches will work. If you 
  want to also build post-xst or post-par test benches read next section.

3. Compile UNISIM/SIMPRIM libraries for ghdl ------------------------------

  The build system for test benches also supports test benches run against
  the gate level models derived after the xst, map or par step. In this
  case ghdl has to link against a compiled UNISIM or SIMPRIM library.

  To make handling of the parallel installion of several WebPack versions
  easy the compiled libraries are stored in sub-directories under $XILINX:

     $XILINX/ghdl/unisim
     $XILINX/ghdl/simprim

  Two helper scripts will create these libraries:

    <setup WebPack, e.g. source .../ISE_DS/settings32.sh>  

    cd $RETROBASE
    xilinx_ghdl_unisim
    xilinx_ghdl_simprim

  If you have several WebPack versions installed, repeat for each version.

4. Compile and install the support software -------------------------------

4a. Compile sharable libraries ---------------------------------------

  Required tools and libraries:
    g++    >= 4.3    (decltype support assumed in usage of boost::bind)
    boost  >= 1.35   (boost::thread api changed, new one is used)

  Build was tested under:
    ubuntu lucid (10.04 LTS):  gcc 4.4.3  boost 1.40.0
    debian lenny (5.0.8):      gcc 4.3.2  boost 1.xx.x (t.b.c.)

  To build all sharable libraries

    cd $RETROBASE/tools/src
    make -j 4

  To cleanup, e.g. before a re-build
    
    cd $RETROBASE/tools/src
    rm_dep
    make realclean

4b. Setup Tcl environment --------------------------------------------

  The Tcl files are organized in several packages. To create the Tcl
  package files (pkgIndex.tcl)

    cd $RETROBASE/tools/tcl
    setup_packages

  To use these packages it is convenient to make them available via the
  'auto_path' mechanism. To do that add in your .tclshrc or .wishrc

    lappend auto_path [file join $env(RETROBASE) tools tcl]
    lappend auto_path [file join $env(RETROBASE) tools lib]

  The w11 distribution contains two ready to use .tclshrc or .wishrc
  files which
    - include the auto_path statements above
    - activate tclreadline (and thus in tclshrc an event loop)

  To use them simply copy them into your home directory (or soft link them)

    cd $HOME
    ln -s $RETROBASE/tools/tcl/.tclshrc .
    ln -s $RETROBASE/tools/tcl/.wishrc  .


5. The build system -------------------------------------------------------

  Simulation and synthesis tools usually need a list of the VHDL source
  files, often in proper compilation order (libraries before components).
  The different tools have different formats of these 'project files'.

  The build system employed in this project is based on 
     "VHDL bill of material" or 'vbom' files
  which list for each vhdl source file the libraries and sources for
  the instantiated components, the later via their vbom, and last but
  not least the name of the vhdl source file. All file name are relative
  to the current directory. A recursive traversal through all vbom's gives
  for each vhld module all sources needed to compile it. The vbomconv script 
  in tools/bin does this, and generates depending on options
   - make dependency files
   - ISE xst project files
   - ISE ISim project files
   - ghdl commands for analysis, inspection and make step

  The master make files contain pattern rules like
    %.ngc  : %.vbom           -- synthesize with xst
    %      : %.vbom           -- build functional model test bench
  which encapsulate all the vbomconf magic

  A full w11a is build from more than 80 source files, test benches from
  even more. Using the vbom's a large number of designs can be easily
  maintained.

6. Building test benches --------------------------------------------------

6a. General instructions ---------------------------------------------

  To compile a test bench named <tbench> all is needed is

    make <tbench>

  The make file will use <tbench>.vbom, create all make dependency files,
  and generate the needed ghdl commands.

  In many cases the test benches can also be compiled against the gate
  level models derived after the xst, map or par step. To compile them

    make ghdl_tmp_clean
    make <tbench>_ssim                  # for post-xst
    make <tbench>_fsim                  # for post-map
    make <tbench>_tsim                  # for post-par

  The 'make ghdl_tmp_clean' is needed to flush the ghdl work area from
  the compilation remains of earlier functional model compiles.

6b. Available test benches -------------------------------------------

  See file w11a_tb_guide.txt

7. Building systems -------------------------------------------------------

7a. General instructions ---------------------------------------------

  To generate a bit file for a system named <sys> all is needed is

    make <sys>.bit

  The make file will use <sys>.vbom, create all make dependency files, build 
  the ucf file with cpp, and run the synthesis flow (xst, ngdbuild, par, trce).
  The log files will be named

      <sys>_xst.log        # xst log file
      <sys>_tra.log        # translate (ngdbuild) log file (renamed %.bld)
      <sys>_map.log        # map log file                  (renamed %_map.mrp)
      <sys>_par.log        # par log file                  (renamed %.par)
      <sys>_pad.log        # pad file                      (renamed %_pad.txt)
      <sys>_twr.log        # trce log file                 (renamed %.twr)
  
  To load the bitfile with WebPack impact into the target board use

    make <sys>.iconfig

  If only the xst or par output is wanted just use

    make <sys>.ngc
    make <sys>.ncd
