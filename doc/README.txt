3. Change Log ----------------------------------------------------------------

- trunk (2011-01-02: svn rev 9(oc) 352(wfjm); untagged w11a_V0.52) +++++++++

  - Summary
    - Introduced rbus protocol V3
    - reorganize rbus and rlink modules, many renames

  - Changes
    - module renames:
      - the rri (remote-register-interface) components were re-organized and
        cleanly separated into rbus and rlink components:
          rri/rb_sres_or_*              -> rbus/rb_sres_or_*     
          rri/rri_core                  -> rlink/rlink_core    
          rri/rri_base_serport          -> rlink/rlink_base_serport    
          rri/rrilib                    -> rbus/rblib    
                                        -> rlink/rlinklib    
          rri/rri_serport               -> rlink/rlink_serport    
          rri/tb/rritb_sres_or_mon      -> rbus/rb_sres_or_mon    
      - the rri test bench monitors were reorganized and renamed
          rri/tb/rritb_cpmon            -> rlink/rlink_mon    
          rri/tb/rritb_cpmon_sb         -> rlink/rlink_mon_sb    
          rri/tb/rritb_rbmon            -> rbus/rb_mon    
          rri/tb/rritb_rbmon_sb         -> rbus/rb_mon_sb    
      - the rri low level test bench were also renamed
          rri/tb/tb_rri                 -> rlink/tb/tb_rlink    
          rri/tb/tb_rri_core            -> rlink/tb/tb_rlink_direct    
          rri/tb/tb_rri_serport         -> rlink/tb/tb_rlink_serport    
      - the base modules for rlink+cext based test benches were renamed
          rri/tb/rritb_core_cm          -> rlink/tb/tbcore_rlink_dcm
          rri/tb/rritb_core             -> rlink/tb/tbcore_rlink
          rri/tb/vhpi_rriext            -> rlink/tb/rlink_cext_vhpi
          rri/tb/cext_rriext.c          -> rlink/tb/rlink_cext.c

      - other rri/rbus related renames
          bplib/s3board/s3_humanio_rri  -> s3_humanio_rbus
          w11a/pdp11_core_rri           -> pdp11_core_rbus

      - other renames
          w11a/tb/tb_pdp11_core         -> tb_pdp11core

    - signal renames:
      - rlink interface (defined in rlink/rlinklib.vhd): 
        - rename rlink port signals:
          CP_*  -> RL_*
        - rename status bit names to better reflect their usage in v3:
          ccrc  -> cerr   - indicates cmd crc error or other cmd level abort
          dcrc  -> derr   - indicates data crc error or other data level abort
          ioto  -> rbnak  - indicates rbus abort, either no ack or timeout
          ioerr -> rberr  - indicates that rbus err flag was set

    - migrate to rbus protocol verion 3
      - in rb_mreq use now aval,re,we instead of req,we
      - basic rbus transaction now takes 2 cycles, one for address select, one
        for data exchange. Same concept and reasoning behind as in ibus V2.

    - vlib/rlink/rlink_core
      - cerr and derr state flags now set on command or data crc errors as well
        as on eop/nak aborts when command or wblk data is received.
      - has now 'monitor port', RL_MONI.
      - RL_FLUSH port removed, the flush logic is now in rlink_serport

    - restructured rlink modules
      - rlink_core is the rlink protocol engine with a 9 bit wide interface
      - rlink_rlb2rl (new) is an adapter to a byte wide interface
      - rlink_base (new) combines rlink_core and rlink_rlb2rl
      - rlink_serport (re-written) is an adapter to a serial interface
      - rlink_base_serport (renamed) combines rlink_base and rlink_serport

  - New features
    - vlib/rbus
      - added several rbus devices useful for debugging
        - rbd_tester: test target, used for example in test benches

- trunk (2010-11-28: svn rev 8(oc) 341(wfjm); untagged w11a_V0.51) ++++++++

  - Summary 
    - Introduced ibus protocol V2
    - Nexys2 systems use DCM
    - sys_w11a_n2 now runs with 58 MHz

  - Changes
    - module renames:
      - in future 'box' is used for large autonomous blocks, therefore use
        the term unit for purely sequential logic modules:
          pdp11_abox -> pdp11_ounit
          pdp11_dbox -> pdp11_aunit
          pdp11_lbox -> pdp11_lunit
          pdp11_mbox -> pdp11_munit

    - signal renames:
      - renamed RRI_LAM -> RB_LAM in all ibus devices
      - renamed CLK     -> I_CLK50 in all top level nexys2 and s3board designs

    - migrate to ibus protocol verion 2
      - in ib_mreq use now aval,re,we,rmw instead of req,we,dip
      - basic ibus transaction now takes 2 cycles, one for address select, one
        for data exchange. This avoids too long logic paths in the ibus logic.

  - New features
    - ibus
      - added ib_sres_or_mon to check for miss-behaving ibus devices
      - added ib_sel to encapsulate address select logic
    - nexys2 systems
      - now DCM derived system clock supported
      - sys_gen/w11a/nexys2
        - sys_w11a_n2 now runs with 58 MHz clksys

  - Bug fixes
    - rtl/vlib/Makefile.xflow: use default .opt files under rtl/vlib again.

- w11a_V0.5 (2010-07-23) ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

  Initial release with 
  - w11a CPU core
  - basic set of peripherals: kw11l, dl11, lp11, pc11, rk11/rk05
  - just for fun: iist (not fully implemented and tested yet)
  - two complete system configurations with 
    - for a Digilent S3BOARD    rtl/sys_gen/w11a/s3board/sys_w11a_s3
    - for a Digilent Nexys2     rtl/sys_gen/w11a/nexys2/sys_w11a_n2
