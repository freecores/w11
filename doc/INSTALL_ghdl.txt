The w11 project uses the open source VHDL simulator

  ghdl

It used to be part of most distributions. Unfortunately the Debian maintainer 
for ghdl refused at some point to integrate ghdl into Debian Etch. Therefore
ghdl is part of Debian Lenny, and again of Debian Squeeze (the current 
'stable'). So for an up-to-date Debian simply install the ghdl package.

The glitch at Debian unfortunately lead to the removal of ghdl from Ubuntu, 
which is based on Debian. Ubuntu Lucid (10.04) and up to Oneiric (11.10) 
included ghdl, the currently maintained versions Precise (12.04 LTS) and 
Quantal (12.10) don't.

Thanks to Peter Gavin Ubuntu packages for GHDL are available from his PPA
'Personal Package Archives', see

So to install ghdl under Ubuntu use

  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:pgavin/ghdl
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install ghdl
