The states are 
 1. grouped by 'flows', related states are in a dashed box
 2. grouped in classes by color
    - blue: idle/fetch/decode states
    - cyan: console handling states
    - light orange: source address mode flow
    - dark orange: destination address mode flows
    - green: states for main opcode handling
    - red: states for error handling

The grey 'fork_...' hexagons represent three transition groups which are 
common to the control flow of several states. There is no corresponding 
state, these symbols just help to reduce the number of transition lines 
on the flow chart.

The transitions are color coded too:
  - green: normal 'forward' transition in a flow
  - blue: i/o wait loop
  - red: error/trap handling
  - magenta: fatal errors to cpufail state
  - thick black: link to a fork_ symbol
  - black: all other transitions
