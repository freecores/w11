       .D 56=5015
       
       .TYPE V4USER.TXT
       Welcome to RT-11 Version 4. RT-11 V04 provides new hardware support
       and some major enhancements over Version 3B.
       
       Please use the HELP command;  it describes the new options in many
       of the utilities.
       
       If you are using a terminal that requires fill characters,
       modify location 56 with a Deposit command before proceeding with
       system installation. LA36 DECwriter II and VT52 DECscope terminals
       do NOT require such modification.
       
       .D 56=0
       
       .

     Now you are at the RT-11 prompt and can exercise the system.

     There is no 'halt' or 'shutdown' command, just terminate the 
     simulator or backend server session.
